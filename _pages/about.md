My name is Ashkan (/æʃkˈʌn/) Shahbazi (/ʃahbɑzɪ/). Ashkan is a Persian name that means "Like Tears." I'm a Ph.D. student arriving in Fall 2022 at Vanderbilt (Vandy), joining to <a href="https://mint-vu.github.io/">Machine Intelligence and Neural Technologies (MINT) Lab</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://skolouri.github.io/">Dr. Soheil Kolouri</a>. Before joining Vandy, I obtained my B.Sc in biomedical engineering from the <a href="https://aut.ac.ir/en">Amirkabir University of Technology</a>, Tehran, Iran in 2021.

I am highly interested in various areas of Machine Learning, especially Mathematical Machine Learning, (Geometric) Deep Learning, and Continual Learning. Also, during my undergraduate studies, I investigated the applications of Machine Learning in Health Care.

My favorite hobby is playing DOTA2 (professional PA player). I also like hiking and nature photography.
